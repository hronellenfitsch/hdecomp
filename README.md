# hdecomp
A python3 version of the hierarchical decomposition code.

This is a new version of the nesting code for hierarchical
decomposition that is compatible with python 3 (and only python 3)
and NetworkX > 2.0.

At present, this code is experimental and can only be used
as a library by directly calling the
function `hierarchical_decomposition` from decomposer.py.
